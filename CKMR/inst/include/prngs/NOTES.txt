Putting together a new prng. Tested 2 things, the xoshiro256** from Vigna and 
Blackman and the pcg class from O'Neill.
xoshiro home page: http://vigna.di.unimi.it/
pcg     home page: https://www.pcg-random.org/

pcg code is from the author.
xoshiro code is from Sean, based off the C code provided by the authors.

I chose the xoshiro256** generator because it was ~10% faster than pcg for us.
Online, there's a huge debate, and both authors think the other author's prng 
is crap. So, pick and camp and go. Both are smaller, faster, and more
statistically sound than the Mersenne Twister.

These were stolen from MGDrivE.
Timings etc are from MGDRivE too, but I'm still using xoshiro256** here.
