# mPlex
Gene drive multiplex model using an ABM.  
  
Design:
create environments to hold each life stage:  
  Egg  
  Larva  
  Pupa  
  Adult  
  
This allows us to apply life-stage related functions to an entire environment:  
Requirements:  
  How to create/destroy critters in an environment  
  How to move things from one environment to another (ie, eggs become larva)  
  Write functions to apply to certain life stages, then have  structure to hold that somehow.
